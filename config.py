### Presentation - General

# All datetime stamps use typical strftime codes: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior

# The date/time stamp of the last (most current) reading.
present_lastread_stamp = "%I:%M %p on %A, %b %d"

# How many decimal places to round to when displaying temperatures. For 
# presentation only - does not impact reading precision in the database.
present_temp_precision = 1


### Presentation - Recent Graph

# The date/time stamp on the x-axis
present_graph_recent_x = "%I:%M %p"

# How many data points to use. 
# This does _not_ reflect how many points will be drawn. Also consider how 
# often the readings are made - e.g., if a value is recorded every 15 minutes,
# then a full day's worth of data requires 24x(60/15) = 96 points.
present_recent_point_count = 720

# How much to reduce the specified number of data points. 
# This is how many points will be drawn. The value of 
# present_recent_point_count is divided in to this many chunks, and then time 
# stamp and value of each chunk is averaged.
present_recent_reduce_to = 16

# The static html file that is output. Must be writable by the user running

# Set to True to print all log messages to the terminal, or False to suppress 
# most output.
